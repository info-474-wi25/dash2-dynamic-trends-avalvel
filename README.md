Temperature Trends

This project focuses on visualizing historical weather data (2014-2015) from multiple U.S. cities, including Indianapolis, Charlotte, and Phoenix. The goal is to analyze temperature trends and precipitation patterns to identify seasonal changes and city-specific weather differences. The dataset includes daily records of temperature, precipitation, and historical weather extremes, allowing for meaningful comparisons. A key feature is a dropdown menu that enables users to switch between cities for easier analysis of weather trends.
